## Features

### Backend

1. **Authentication**:
   - User registration and login functionality using JWT tokens.
   - Secure API endpoints to ensure only authenticated users can access them.

2. **Book Management**:
   - API endpoints for CRUD operations on books.
   - Validation for incoming book data, including title, author, price, etc.

3. **Book Categories and Subcategories**:
   - API endpoints to manage book categories and subcategories.
   - Each category and subcategory has a name and optional description.

4. **Shopping Cart and Orders**:
   - APIs to manage the user's shopping cart, including category and subcategory details.
   - Users can add books to the cart, view the cart, and place orders.

5. **Order Processing**:
   - API endpoint to process orders.
   - Calculates the total price and updates book quantities upon receiving an order.

6. **Database**:
   - Uses a relational database (e.g., MySQL) to store book, user, category, and subcategory data.
   - Establishes relationships between books and categories/subcategories.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Implementation of error handling and appropriate HTTP status codes for different scenarios.
